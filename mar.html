				Backstory
				<br></br>
				Superman is an alien that came from Krypton. He has many powers that ordinary humans don not. 
				These include flight, x-ray vision, superhuman strength and super speed. With these powers, he could destroy everything on Earth, however he chooses to use his powers for good. 
				He also has to find a way to blend in with the humans which can be a challenge. He is able to do all of these things, and that is very admirable.
